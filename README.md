# Birthday-List

Hello people, This is my first mini project using React

Languages And Frameworks Used

1.HTML (JSX) <br>
2.CSS<br>
3.JAVASCRIPT<br>
4.REACT<br>

## About the Repository

Its just a simple list of Birthdays with a few buttons and onClick events happening.

## Things I Learned

Making this repo made me familiar with React especially with one of its Hook useState. Using react makes things simple,handy and more organised, compare to doing it without the framework.
